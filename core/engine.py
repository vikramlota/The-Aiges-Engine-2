"""
Vishwas AI -- Phase 1 disclosure compliance rule engine.

Given structured details about a single post, decides whether it complies
with ASCI/CCPA disclosure rules, and -- critically -- explains why in
plain language. This automates columns J-R of the "Audit Checklist"
spreadsheet tab; a human still owns "Reviewer Explanation" and
"Recommended Fix" (the two columns after that), since those require
judgment this engine deliberately doesn't try to replace.

Design principle carried over from the project's compliance gate: every
FLAGGED or PENDING result comes with a plain-language reason attached.
There is no bare pass/fail anywhere in this module.
